# Math Eval
A simple PEMDAS expression evaluator written in C.
The parser is a [Top Down Operator Precedence](https://tdop.github.io/) parser.
## Things I learned
I was doing some research on parsing algorithms, after making a [RiSC](https://github.com/CrazyGuy108/RiSC) assembler and emulator, when I found out about TDOP. It's a really cool algorithm that views parsing in a whole other perspective, though a not very popular perspective. Also, doing this project in C helped me figure out how exactly OOP concepts are even implemented by e.g. a C++ compiler.
